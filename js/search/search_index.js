DlDateTimePickerDateModule\n* Moment Date: import DlDateTimePickerMomentModule\n* Milliseconds (local): import DlDateTimePickerNumberModule\n* String (local): import DlDateTimePickerStringModule\nA DateAdapter is used to adapt the data type in the model to the number data type \nused internally by the date/time picker.\nIf you need a different data type than what is currently supported, you can extend \nDlDateAdapter to provide the data type you need then override the DlDateAdapter \nprovider in app.module.ts to use your new class. \nproviders: [{provide: DlDateAdapter, useClass: MyCustomDateAdapter}],\nDisplay format\nThe display format is defined in the DL_DATE_TIME_DISPLAY_FORMAT token and is injected into this component\nto control the display format.\nDL_DATE_TIME_DISPLAY_FORMAT defaults to moment's lll long date format. \nOverride DL_DATE_TIME_DISPLAY_FORMAT if you do not like the default format.\n{provide: DL_DATE_TIME_DISPLAY_FORMAT, useValue: ''} \nInput formats\nThis directive supports multiple input formats, as defined in the DL_DATE_TIME_INPUT_FORMATS token.\nWhen the user inputs a string value into a text box, this directive attempts to parse the input\nusing one of the specified formats, in the order the format occur in the array. \nOnce one of the formats is able to parse the user input, the date is set in the model. \nNota bene For convenience DL_DATE_TIME_INPUT_FORMATS defaults to support multiple formats, \nwhich can dramatically slow down paring performance. It can also result is successfully parsing \na date using a format that is not appropriate for your use case. \nConsider overriding the DL_DATE_TIME_INPUT_FORMATS token to only include only the specific formats required by your project. \n{provide: DL_DATE_TIME_INPUT_FORMATS, useValue: ['', ..., '']} \nSee moment's parsing multiple formats \npage for more information on how these date formats are used. \n\n    \n\n    \n        import {Directive, ElementRef, EventEmitter, forwardRef, HostListener, Inject, Input, Output, Renderer2} from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n

          Implemented by classes that provide models for the date/time picker.\nThe terms left, right, up, and down are used in place of\nprevious, next, etc so that the model provider is UI centric\nrather than time direction centric.\nFor example, another calendar implementations may render future dates to the left.\nHaving the api method goLeft may move the active cell to a\nfuture or past value depending on the calendar implementation,\nbut both operations are performed with the left-arrow key.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n

by Twitter Bootstrap 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nDemo Page\nGithub\nRead this in other languages: Spanish\nOn Angular 1.x?\nSee angularjs-bootstrap-datetimepicker\nSupport the project\nI know this is a tiny component but many people use it in production (high 5 to all of us) - if you happen to use this component please click the star button (at the top of the page) - it means a lot to all the contributors.\nPeer Dependencies\nPeer dependencies:\n * Angular 7.x or higher (1.x will not work)\n * moment.js 2.22.2 or higher for date parsing and formatting\n * bootstrap 4.x for css/layout\n * open-iconic for the default icon's (you can use any icon libary you like)\njQuery is NOT required.\nUsage with Angular CLI\nIf you are using the Angular CLI there are a few simple steps to \nadd this component to your project.\nFirst, install this module and it's peer dependencies.\nshell\nnpm install --save angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker bootstrap moment open-iconic\nThen update ./src/app/app.module.ts to include the following:\n```TypeScript\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { DlDateTimeDateModule, DlDateTimePickerModule } from 'angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    DlDateTimeDateModule,  // \nNext, add the following to ./src/app/app.component.html\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\nNext, add the following to ./src/styles.css\ncss\n@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n@import '~open-iconic/font/css/open-iconic-bootstrap.css';\nNote: This component uses open-iconic icons by default, but you can use any icon library \nthat supports styling with classes.\nFinally, run npm start and you should see the date/time picker on http://localhost:4200/\nBy default, the date/time picker is as wide as it's container { width:100% }. \nIt uses bootstrap's flex row and col classes to layout the date/time picker into rows and columns.\nIf the parent container is too narrow (less than 340px in english), the row and column layout may wrap in ways that are not attractive. \nOther languages/locals may require a wider container to fit the contents.\nConfiguration\nUse the automated configuration generator (please let me know if it does not work for your use case!), \nor see https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/\nfor the automatically generated documentation.\nFirst day of week\nThe first day of the week is determined by  moment's i18n settings.\nFor example, setting the locale to 'fr' will cause Monday to be the first day of the week.  \nDisplay of year, month, day, hour, am/pm, and minute formats\nThe format of hours and minutes is also determined by moment's i18n settings.\nhours are displayed using ll as the format.\nminutes are displayed using lll as the format. \nI recommend you use the default locale settings from Moment (if they are incorrect, submit a PR to moment to correct the settings)\nIf for some reason the default Moment settings will not work, you can customize the existing locale or create a custom locale with the desired formats.\nDocumentation\nYou can generate the documentation by running npm run documentation\nor see https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/\nAccessibility\nThe DlDateTimePickerComponent component adds aria-label attributes to the left, right, and up buttons\nin addition to all calendar cells where the text of the cell may not fully describe the value.\nKeyboard Accessibility\nThe DlDateTimePickerComponent component supports the following keyboard shortcuts in all views:\n| Shortcut             | Action                                          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| LEFT_ARROW         | Go to the cell to the left                      |\n| RIGHT_ARROW        | Go to the cell to the right                     |\n| UP_ARROW           | Go to the cell above                            |\n| DOWN_ARROW         | Go to the cell below                            |\n| HOME               | Go to the first cell in the view                |\n| END                | Go to the last cell in the view                 |\n| PAGE_UP            | Go to the same cell in the previous time period |\n| PAGE_DOWN          | Go to the same cell in the next time period     |\n| ENTER or SPACE   | Select current cell                             |\nScreen shots\nYear view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the year for the target date.\nIf the year view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the first day of the year\nMonth view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the month in the selected year.\nIf the month view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the first day of the month.\nDay view (Default)\n\nThis view allows the user to select the the day of the month, in the selected month.\nIf the day view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the day selected.\nHour view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the hour of the day, on the selected day.\nIf the hour view is the minView, the date will be set to the beginning of the hour on the day selected.\nMinute view\n\nThis view allows the user to select a specific time of day, in the selected hour.\nBy default, the time is displayed in 5 minute increments. The minuteStep property controls the increments of time displayed.\nIf the minute view is the minView, which is is by default, the date will be set to the beginning of the hour on the day selected.\nContributing\nSee Contributing.md\nTesting\nThis component was written using TDD and all enhancements and changes have related tests.\nWe use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use gulp:\nshell\nnpm install\nnpm test\nThe karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests.\nMake sure Chrome is available or change the browsers setting in karma.config.js\nLicense\nangular-bootstrap-datetimepicker is released under the MIT license and is copyright 2015 Knight Rider Consulting, Inc..
